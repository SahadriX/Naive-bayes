## 📊 Naive-bayes

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** using the **Naive Bayes** algorithm for classification tasks on text or tabular data. It leverages Gaussian or Multinomial variants depending on the data type.

### 🧠 Project Objective
To build a probabilistic classification model that:
- Handles both text and tabular data efficiently 📄  
- Demonstrates the power of **Naive Bayes** for high-dimensional datasets  
- Covers the full pipeline from data cleaning to model evaluation 🧹

---

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 🧠 scikit-learn  
- 📊 Pandas & NumPy  
- 📝 Text vectorization tools (CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer)  
- 📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

---

### 🧩 Key Features
- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- 🔤 Text vectorization for natural language inputs  
- 🔍 Uses Gaussian or Multinomial Naive Bayes based on data type  
- 📊 Model training, prediction, and evaluation with metrics  
- 📈 Visualizes performance metrics and confusion matrices

---

### 🧮 How the Model Works
1. **Preprocess data**: clean and prepare input data  
2. **Vectorize text data** (if applicable) for ML compatibility  
3. **Train Naive Bayes model** (Gaussian or Multinomial variant)  
4. **Evaluate model** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
5. **Visualize results** with confusion matrix and performance charts
